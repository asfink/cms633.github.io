I've always known that web history is complicated. The internet was made to befast, and changes are happening all the time making it's preservation basically impossible. Even if we were able to preserve every webpage ever created/updated/hosted, it'd be physically impossible. There would be so much data from videos, images, and text that it would be impossible to reasonably maintain the preservation of the web. It is a noble cause in my opinion. 

It would be cool to be able to preserve websites while allowing them to remain functional (ie when FB keeps chaning it's layout and everyone is sad, people can keep using the old layout instead). But again, that is not maintainable. In the meantime, the attempt to preserve the web has been okay in regards to that which is accessable to the public. There have been times int he past where i have had to accesss old web pages for some reason or another, but the preserved version I found was lacking a lot of crucial details (like those mentioned in the reading). I was able to get wheat I needed to learn from the old version, however it was still extremely frusturating. It would be nice to see some way to get a viable useable snapshot, but as mentioned before, that's really hard to do.
